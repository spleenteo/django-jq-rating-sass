django jquery rating plugin in sass/scss
=====================

the sass/scss version of jquery django rating plugin.

http://www.fyneworks.com/jquery/star-rating/

I did used this plugin a few times. It's great! but to personalize it and to integrate it in a modular css framework could be so easy.

I do love scss so I wrote a version to style this plugin with some configuration variables to make it more friendly to change the ratings desing.

I don't like the gif version of the stars provided; I prefered to use PNG version. Here you can find the PSD file with layers to change your "star" and "delete" icons. After that, simply change the config part of the scss file and run your sass command to rebuild the final css.

Do what you want with this file.
